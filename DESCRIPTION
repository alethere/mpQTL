Description: mpQTL offers a suite of functions to perform QTL analysis using
    a single marker regression methodology in a mixed model framework. The model
    used, known as the "unified mixed model", estimates population structure 
    using a relatedness matrix (K), and thus has no requirments regarding the 
    population structure (it accepts F1, GWAS panels, multi-parental populations...).
    Unlike other packages, mpQTL offers the possibility to apply these models 
    in any level of ploidy using both SNPs and multi-allelic genotypes.
    Besides the statistical functions, it also incorporates a set of visualization
    functions to help analyze the results of the QTL studies.
