Description: mpQTL offers a suite of functions to perform QTL analysis using
    a single marker regression methodology in a mixed model framework. Such a mixed model
    approach enables to account for different levels of population structure, combining 
    main fixed effect coordinates of variation with random effects based on a relatedness
    matrix (K). Although mpQTL has been initially designed for multi-parental populations,
    in fact it can be used to run association analyses in any structured population 
    (it accepts pedigreed families, multi-parental populations, GWAS panels, etc.). Also,
    mpQTL enables to apply these models for any level of ploidy, using both SNPs (discrete
    or continuous) and multi-allelic genotypes (e.g. haplotypes).
    Besides the statistical functions, it incorporates a set of visualization
    functions to help interpreting the results of a QTL study.
